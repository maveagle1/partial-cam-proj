# Create-React-App Todo List with Redux-Form and Redux-Promise-Middleware

To get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/react-redux-todo-starter.git
cd react-redux-todo-starter
npm install
npm start
```

There is one test currently failing in the App component, which should have been fixed by exporting the App component separately from the "connected" exported component. If you can fix that, send a PR.
